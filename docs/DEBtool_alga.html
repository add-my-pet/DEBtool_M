      Nutrient-limited growth of algae in reactors: more reserves, 1 structure, V1-morph

      <p>
      This implementation accounts for: <BR>
      effects of ammonia and phosphate concentrations in the feed (X_Nr, X_Pr), throughput rates (h) and temperature (T). <BR>
      These environmental parameters are taken to be constant in the present implementation, but it is not difficult to let them vary in time. 
      Limitations by light, carbon and other can be implemented as well. 
      Two other nutrients can be substituted for ammonia and phosphate.

      <p>
      Organic compounds (that make up the alga):<BR>
      V = structure, EN = N-reserve, EP = P-reserve,<BR>
      Mineral compounds:<BR>
      C = carbon dioxide, H = water, O = dioxygen, <BR>
      N = ammonia, P = phosphate,
      DN = excreted N-reserve, DP = excreted P-reserve
   
      <p>
      Uptake is proportional to surface area, which is taken to be proportional to the structural volume: V1-morph. 
      This removes the distinction between the individual and the population level.

      <p>
      The simplification k_J = k_M*(1 - kap)/kap is implemented, which makes this energy-structured model also size-structured <BR>
      The alga divides when the structural mass exceeds a threshold value

      Reserve dynamics and algal growth at cycling nutrient concentrations;
      concentrations of nutrients N and P follow a parameterized cycling function of time (which is described in script-file <code>pars_cycle</code>). 
      Amplitude, period and phase-shift between the nutrients can be specified. 
      A vector of reserve turnover rates can be specified; 
      large turnover rates imply small reserve capacities. 
      Notice that the growth rate can be largest for the highest reserve capacity, if situations where both required nutrients are present are rare.  
      Parameters are set in script-file <code>pars_cycle</code>.

      The function obtains the specific assimilation rate of carbohydrates for oxygenic photosynthesis and the flux of captured, but not processed photons, whcich fuel fluorescense.
      It accounts for photo-synthesis, photo-respiration and photo-inhibition.
      Photons and carbon dioxide, as well as photons and dioxygen, are treated as parallelly processed complemantary compounds,
      while carbon dioxide and dioxygen are substitutable compounds.
      Photo-inhbition occurs when photons bind to a photon-SU complex; recovery from this situation occurs when one of the photons is released.
      The intracellular concentration of carbon dioxide and dioxygen is affected by growth and maintenance.
      Maintenance is fuelled by corbohydrates only, in terms of O2 and CO2.
      The stoichiometry of the growth process assumes NO3 as complementary compound.
